# DMS Analysis Manager

The DMS Analysis Tool Manager is a part of the PRISM, the
Proteomics Research Information and Management System.
The analysis manager performs automated processing of available job steps, 
tracked by the in the DMS_Pipeline database.  Plugin DLLs implement
the processing details for each analysis tool.
