#Parent mass tolerance 
#  Examples: 2.5Da or 30ppm

#Target/Decoy search mode
#  0 means don't search decoy database (default)

#Fragmentation Method
#  0 means as written in the spectrum or CID if no info (Default)

#Number of allowed C13 peaks
#  Takes into account that 2nd or 3rd isotope may have been chosen for fragmentation
#  If 1, then considers expPeptideMass-1.00335

#Number of allowed non-enzymatic termini
#  The number of allowed peptide termini that are not cleaved by the enzyme (default 1)

#Amino Acid Frequencies
#  If 0, compute amino acid frequencies from the input database and use them as amino acid probabilities
