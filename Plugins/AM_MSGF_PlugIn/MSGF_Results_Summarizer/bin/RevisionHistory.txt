MSGF Results Summarizer Change Log

Version 1.1.5683; July 24, 2015
	- When finding PSMs and unique peptide counts, now ignoring the position of modifications in peptides (though order still matters)
		- For example, PEPT*IDES and PEPTIDES* are treated as the same peptide
	- Now only using the top scoring hit for each scan
		- Led to exaggerated PSM and unique peptide counts for phosphopeptides

	- New version of AnalysisManagerMSGFPlugin.dll that uses MSXML_Generator.dll (which in turn uses AnalysisManagerMsXmlGenPlugIn.dll)
