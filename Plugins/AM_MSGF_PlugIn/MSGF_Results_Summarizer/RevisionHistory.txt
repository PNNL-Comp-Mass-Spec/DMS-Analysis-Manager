MSGF Results Summarizer Change Log

Version 1.1.6116; September 29, 2016
	- Improved logic that determines normalized peptides
		- Peptides are merged only if they have the same clean sequence and each of the modifications is on the the same residue or one residue away
	- Added new counts: KeratinPeptides, TrypsinPeptides, TrypticPeptides, MissedCleavageRatio, and Phosphopeptides

Version 1.1.5683; July 24, 2015
	- When finding PSMs and unique peptide counts, now ignoring the position of modifications in peptides (though order still matters)
		- For example, PEPT*IDES and PEPTIDES* are treated as the same peptide
	- Now only using the top scoring hit for each scan
		- Led to exaggerated PSM and unique peptide counts for phosphopeptides

Version 1.1.4688; November 1, 2012
	- New version of AnalysisManagerMSGFPlugin.dll that uses MSXML_Generator.dll (which in turn uses AnalysisManagerMsXmlGenPlugIn.dll)

Version 1.1.4511; May 8, 2012
	- Now computing stats first with an MSGF threshold, then with an FDR threshold
	- New version of PHRPReader.dll

Version 1.1.4499; April 26, 2012
	- New version of PHRPReader.dll
		- Loads data from SeqInfo files
		- Uses ThermoRawFileReaderDLL.dll

Version 1.1.4478; April 5, 2012
	- Updated to use PHRPReader.dll

Version 1.0.4434; February 21, 2012
	- Initial version
